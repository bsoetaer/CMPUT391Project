TODO: Elaborate on first two steps, setup DB name, no git clone as
it brings unwanted files.

Steps:
1. Get DB server set up
2. Get Tomcat set up
3. cd catalina/webapps
4. git clone "repo url"
5. cd CMPUT391Project
6. cp index.html ../ROOT/index.html (Sets up homepage. May want to make copy of
original index.html in ROOT before copying.)
7. edit META-INF/context.xml to put own DB username and password in.
8. Code Modules without entering username/password. See login2.jsp (which will
eventually become just login.jsp) for an example on connection setup. (You will
need to include all the includes that are included in login2.jsp except maybe
javax.naming.*)

Access web pages through:
<comp-name>:<port>/CMPUT391Project/<file>
example:
ui04.cs.ualberta.ca:16050/CMPUT391Project/login/login.jsp


TODO: Remove point 8 and continue future steps.
